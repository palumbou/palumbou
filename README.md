## 👨‍💻 Who I Am

Hello! I'm **Ugo**, an IT Operations Manager and Cloud Architect with a passion for technology, open-source projects, and simplifying complex systems.

I started tinkering with computers and other technological wonders when I was just a child. Since those early days, nothing has changed: my passion and curiosity have remained constant, only the problems have evolved, and solving them is one of my passions.

I specialize in cloud architecture, Linux systems and configuration management.
